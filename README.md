# Tableau-Netflix-Dashboard

This project delves into a dataset of netflix films and metrics such as release date, country origin, rating, and film type. My goal with this project was to make an interactive dashboard using Tableau in order to explore relationships between some of these variables, and also design it in a way that is visually striking.
